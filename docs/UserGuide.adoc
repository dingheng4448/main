== Introduction

*PlanMySem* is a CLI (Command Line Interface) scheduling/calendar application that targets NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their schedule/calendar.
More importantly, *PlanMySem* is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more efficiently with CLI tools.
Additionally, unlike traditional calendar/scheduling applications, *PlanMySem* utilizes minimal resources on the user’s machine while still allowing the user to view their schedules swiftly and efficiently.

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `planmysem.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
